# Egypt-Agent-Based-Model-Simulation

The project shows how inequality in the form of grain accumulation, arose in Early Egypt, given an initial even distribution of resources. This project re-implements an existing Agent-Based Model (ABM) currently coded in the NetLogo language, and implements class hierarchy extensions to create a suitable, informative and easily understandable program for social scientists, archaeologists and anthropologists to observe a graphical simulation on different “what-if” hypotheses. The user will input various “society start parameters”, which will be used in the simulation to show the different states which emerge based on different parameters. Once setup, the simulation will display how households grow, shrink and farm using a combination of chance and slight variance, together with a changing environment in the form of annual floods over a given period of time.
Ultimately, showing how many small Neolithic farming communities became one large state led by Pharaoh.

Created in python, extensively utilising numpy and matplotlib libraries

Simulate.py is the main class. To run, clone this repo and run the simulate python class
